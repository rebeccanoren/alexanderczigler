  <p class="my-4 mx-2">I am Alexander Czigler. I help companies improve their culture and ways of working with code.
    When I am not at my keyboard I love dancing, reading and being out in nature.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mx-2">My story began around 1997 when I got my first PC with dialup internet. I quickly became
    enchanted by the web and it did not take long until I wanted to build my own homepage so that I
    could become a part of the web myself. Dialup was expensive I was only allowed to go online for
    a few hours every week. I spent that precious time online learning about HTML (and playing
    Flight Simulator 98!) and finding free hosts where I could publish my creations.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mx-2">In 2003 my journey took a giant leap as I got DSL at home. This was a huge thing for me as I was
    suddenly able to go online as much as I wanted; I was no longer restricted by the cost or speed
    of dialup. Having 24/7 access to the internet meant I could spend more time on the social
    aspects of the internet. I eventually found a bunch of like-minded people on IRC and I started
    making friends online. Some of the people I got to know taught me about things like linux and
    running my own servers. They inspired me to build my own computer for the first time, a computer
    that became my first home server where I installed linux for the first time in my life and I
    learned how to setup my own web server among other things.

  <h4 class="font-fira-code text-lg pt-10 mb-4 font-semibold">Researching transport efficiency in rural Sweden (2020‚Äî2021)
    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>Predictive Movement is a research project that aims to improve transports and living conditions in the rural areas of Sweden. One of the main hypotheses of Predictive Movement is that citizens in rural parts of Sweden do not have access to the same level of service and quality of life that citizens in urban areas have. While working on the project we validated this hypothesis and we studied ways to both simulate the current ways that transport run and ways to improve them. These improvements whow that transports can be made more efficient, saving both money and lowering their environmental impact while at the same time improving living conditions for citizens and business living and operating in rural and remote parts of Sweden.</p>
<p>During the time I was working with Predictive Movement we developed a platform for route optimization as well as a digital twin that simulates the way road and air transports work in Sweden. I worked on UI sketches for the systems, I performed user testing and hosted workshops for testing and educating/enrolling third parties in the platforms. We also conducted a couple of real-world study visits and user testing where I travelled to both Ljusdal and Pajala together with a couple of coworkers. My main contribution in this project was to plan and coordinate these trips as well as summarize what we learned from them.</p>
<p>Towards the end I also worked on the code behind both the platform and the digital twin and I helped troubleshoot and modify the kubernetes hosting environment. The solutions were built using nodejs, elixir, typescript and rxjs. Other technologies used: using Open Street Map, Mapbox, Figma, Telegram.</p>

    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>This was my second assignment at TRR and this time I returned to do UX research instead of writing code. Over the course of about a year I helped TRR understand their role on the Swedish job market and how they can maximize their impact.</p>
<p>We started off with a series of workshops that my senior UX coworker facilitated. We began by doing an effect mapping and using what we learned from that we did a design sprint. The outputs of these workshops were turned into interactive design sketches that we built using Figma and I performed a number of user tests to validate our ideas. As we began building the new digital product I later performed a number of interviews with HR managers at both small and large Swedish companies to test our product and learn more about how it can be of use to companies looking to hire.</p>
<p>At TRR I worked closely with my then coworker <a href="https://rebeccanoren.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rebecca Nor√©n</a> who taught me a lot of valuable things about interviewing people, working with prototypes, workshops and of course customer focus.</p>
<p>In addition to the qualitative research I also setup heatmaps and event trackings in Matomo.</p>
    </span><h4 class="font-fira-code text-lg pt-10 mb-4 font-semibold">Building Telenor&#39;s fighter brand Vimla (2014‚Äî2018)
    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>I built the backend &amp; API that made up the CMS and the bridge between the customer self-service pages and Telenor‚Äôs backoffice system CDRator. I also built and maintained integrations with payment providers (DIBS, Klarna) as well as the community software Lithium.</p>
<p>During my time at Vimla we moved between technology stacks and payment providers. In the beginning our API and CMS was entirely .NET based and we hosted everything in a Microsoft environment. After a couple of years we saw the need to build up a public API. The API would serve the coming mobile app and function as a platform for third-party developers as well.</p>
<p>The public API was built using nodejs and I setup a docker-based hosting environment for it. Later on we also began migrating the .NET-based website, order workflow, knowledge base and self-service pages to modern html+js applications that all utilised the public API.</p>
<p>As we moved towards a docker and linux based hosting environment we also moved from TFS to using Git and running automated builds and testing in TeamCity.</p>
    </span><h4 class="font-fira-code text-lg pt-10 mb-4 font-semibold">Kick-starting a Flash to HTML + Native Client rewrite (2014‚Äî2015)
    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>PowerFX came to us because they were looking to rebuild their Soundation Studio from the ground up, using html and javascript. The studio was originally built using Flash and since its original release the capabilites of javascript and browsers have improved significally (while Flash was a dying platform).</p>
<p>Myself and two coworkers had a set timebox of roughly 100 hours to begin the web transformation. We started from a blank Angular project and implemented the basic layout of Soundation Studio. We implemented the play/pause functionality, the possibility to add multiple tracks with some individual sound settings and the ability to browse the audio/effect library as well. To be able to play, mix and transform audio we used a native-client (NaCl) bridge for javascript that communicated with the Soundation Studio backend.</p>
<p>After spending the initial timebox we were confident that rebuilding the studio to a pure web based solution was both possible and viable.</p>

    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>iBusiness hired me and a few other consultants to manage their technology stack when all of their regular IT staff had left the company. It was a very interesting assignment because we had to learn how everything worked by ourselves since there was nobody else to introduce us to the software ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the beginning me and the other consultants began by discovering all of the available source code and figuring out which branch(es) held the latest changes used in production. Then, using the source code and the production environments, we studied the systems and figured out their interdependencies. Once we were confident enough to make deployments to production we began fixing critical bugs and building new features to keep iBusiness‚Äô end users satisfied.</p>
<p>Our work led to the company staying afloat and being able to hire new developers and techs, thus reducing their dependency on consultants. To me this was a very educational and fun experience because of the special circumstances in the beginning.</p>

    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>At Getinge I built a number of small Business Intelligence applications. These provided decision makers in their organisation with key data about their production and shipping. I also built a web based system for managing Getinge‚Äôs aftermarket prices, called PriceManager.</p>
<p>PriceManager was a .NET web app written in C# and the other BI applications were made using Dataset Vision. This assigned was one of the first things I did with C# and I learned a lot about web development in .NET. This project also taught me a lot about mainframes like Movex/Lawson M3 and building data warehouses in SQL Server.</p>
    </span><h4 class="font-fira-code text-lg pt-10 mb-4 font-semibold">Doing various freelance gigs (2004‚Äî2013)
    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>During these years I did a number of freelance gigs. I helped clients by designing and building websites, setting up linux servers, building macro-based Excel applications and much much more.</p>
<p>I pretty much helped people and companies wherever I could and I learned so much about all kinds of things; from networking and operating systems to graphical design.</p>

    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>Urban Girls Movement ran a <a href="https://globalutmaning.se/pin/urbangirlsmovement/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a> that aimed to improve living conditions for girls and young women in rapidly growing, socio-economically vulnerable urban areas through feminist urban planning.</p>
<p>A part of this project was letting girls redesign their neighbourhood inside Minecraft. I helped export the minecraft build to a model that was viewable on the web and 3D-printable for their exhibition.</p>

    </h4>
    <span class="space-y-4 mx-2"><p>I built a custom web based ticketing system for Electrolux Group Treasury that they used for IT Change Management. Having a solid, well-defined process for tracking changes was an important step for Electrolux towards becoming SOX compliant. The technical solution was built using .NET and MVC with a SQL Server for storing data.</p>
<p>This was the very first project where I used MVC instead of web forms and I learned a lot about .NET and developing more modern web apps.</p>
